WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR CRICKET FAST 
BOWLERS 
Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna - Final year Project  | 2021
Athlete workload data during practice sessions gathered using wearable 
IMU sensors and analysis was done using deep learning. Then extracted 
data and recommendations for future practice sessions are given in a user-
friendly manner using a web application. During this project, I got to 
experience how to develop and deploy a complete end-to-end data science 
project and to use the tools, Django web framework, and PostgreSQL 
database system.
HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION METHOD USING WEARABLE 
SENSOR DATA AND DEEP LEARNING
https://github.com/sathish-ekanayaka/Human-Activity-Recognition-Project | 
2021
Three deep learning models. a CNN, an LSTM, and a CNN-LSTM were 
developed to do human activity recognition tasks using wearable IMU 
sensor data. After three models were developed, the optimum performing 
model was selected based on compromising between accuracy measures 
and processing time. 
A MODEL FOR PREDICT THE FIRST INNING SCORE OF AN ODI 
CRICKET MATCH
https://github.com/sathish-ekanayaka/Predicting-the-first-innings-score-of-an-od
i-cricket-match. | 2020
A machine learning model using Random Forrest Regressor developed by 
feeding ball by ball data of past cricket matches to predict the ﬁrst innings' 
projected score within a 15 run difference range when current data of the 
game is given as the input.

AN IMAGE  RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR A TOURISM 
WEBSITE
For a Foreign Client  | 2021
A recommendation system for a Tourism Web Site was developed using 
Random Forest Classiﬁer algorithm. A large dataset about the tourists who 
visited Saudi Arabia is used to train the model. An image is selected to 
display based on Ethnicity, Age, Level of Education, and Marital Status of the 
user.
ROMANIZED SINHALA TO SINHALA TEXT CONVERTER
For a Local Client | 2021
An Intelligent system using a Bidirectional LSTM algorithm was developed 
to convert Romanized Sinhala(Singlish) text to a text with Sinhala letters. 
This enables the user to type Sinhala texts conveniently and robustly.
SAFETY SYSTEM FOR MOTOR BIKE RIDERS
Faculty of Engineering ,University of Ruhuna  | 2019
A 
system 
designed 
and 
implemented 
using 
an 
Atmega 
328p 
microcontroller and C to check whether the person is appropriate for a ride 
based on his heart rate and alcohol concentration of breath. 
If the person is not in an appropriate condition an alarm will be switched on.  
The scientiﬁc paper, "Work Load Management System for Cricketers"  
based on our ﬁnal year undergraduate project was selected to present 
at the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in 
Medicine and Biology Society which will be held on 31st October 2021.
